# TO-DO List App

![Design preview for the TO-DO List App](./Design/Desktop%20Design.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end Project.

**To do this Project, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The Project

This project is to build out this TODO List App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Enter and Delete TODOs
- Set TODOs to completed/incompleted.
- Delete all TODOs together.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
